# secret santa
this is a secret santa generator I am in the process of creating using php and phpMyAdmin. 

# how it works

the user is prompted to input the names of the participates as well as 2-3 gifts each participant may want. 
the database is set up with 3 tables, participants, matches, and gifts. the program randomly generates matches for each participant and stores them. when ready, an email is sent to every participant consisting of who they have to buy a gift for as well as the recommended gift options.

# future plans
* getting it to work lol
* a proper UI
* additional features like including the time/place of the get together
